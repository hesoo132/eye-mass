## ðŸ”Ž Overview
**Eye-Mass** is a custom embedded hardware board designed for **real-time image processing and AI experimentation**.  
It integrates a camera (OV5640), external SDRAM, motor control, and communication interfaces to enable tasks such as **capturing and analyzing images of components inside a box**.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Features

| Component               | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Debug LED**           | Visual feedback for board status and firmware debugging                 |
| **SDRAM**               | Additional memory for buffering image data and running lightweight AI   |
| **OV5640 Camera**       | Captures images (e.g., counting SMD components inside a box)            |
| **Motor Driver**        | Moves the camera to capture the entire box view                         |
| **FDCAN**               | High-speed, reliable communication with external modules                |
| **USART**               | Serial interface for debugging and logging                              |
| **Temperature Sensor**  | Monitors motor driver and board ambient temperature                     |
| **Current/Voltage Monitor** | Measures system power consumption and provides protection           |
